- Bugs:
	- Very small sphere lights introduce severe banding in light attentuation.

- Iterative intersections:
    - Figure out how to DRY stuff
    - Get working with motion blur
    - Displacement tests

- Unit tests:
	- BitStack
	- BitStack2

- Ray stream tracing:
	- Optimizations...

- Multiple importance sampling

- Infinite lights (e.g. sun lights) will be considered part of the background,
  along with e.g. HDRI lighting backgrounds.

- Parsing:
	- Give useful error messages...

- PsychoBlend:
	- Export Group instances as assemblies
	- Allow per-object motion blur segment specification

- Implement a shading system
	- Proper ray differentials
	- Stupid simple shaders first
	- Then use OSL

- More geometry types:
	//- Bicubic bezier patches
	- Catmull-clark subdivision surfaces
	- Triangle meshes
	//- Make spheres work again

- Adaptive sampling scheme
	- "Population Monte Carlo"

- Film class:
	- Make film class more data-type agnostic.  It should be the responsibility
	  of the Renderer and Integrator to make sure pixel data is interpretted and
	  used correctly.

- Cleanup:
	- Add NaN and Inf catching to key places in code
	- Surface Primitives should calculate their own pre-displacement surface normals

- Splitting:
	- Splitting code should have protection against stack overflow.
