- Bugs:
	//- Very small sphere lights introduce severe banding in light attentuation.
	- Some scenes hang when rendering at high sample rates.

- Iterative intersections:
    - Displacement tests

- Unit tests:
	- BitStack
	- BitStack2

- Ray stream tracing:
	- Optimizations...

- Multiple importance sampling

- LightTree:
    - Investigate using importance resampling along with leaf nodes that have
      more than one light in them.
    - Investigate having the BSDF's provide methods for working with the
      LightTree, to better optimize light selection based on the BSDF.

//- Hero wavelength spectral rendering

- Change assemblies to use a memory arena for object/shader/etc. data.

- Light sources:
    - Infinite lights (e.g. sun lights) will be considered part of the background,
      along with e.g. HDRI lighting backgrounds.
    - Point lights should be a special-case of sphere lights, with radius zero.
    - Spot lights
    //- Rectangular area lights
    - A way to mark other objects as light sources, for MIS (this can't be done
      automatically in the general case...?)

- Parsing:
	- Give useful error messages...
	- Support binary geometry files of some kind, for faster scene loading

- PsychoBlend:
	- Allow per-object motion blur segment specification

- Shading system
	//- Stupid simple shaders first
	- A few hard-coded displacement shaders, to verify the ideas work (e.g.
	  with interval arithmetic).
	- Then use OSL

- More geometry types:
	- Catmull-clark subdivision surfaces
	- Triangle meshes

- Film class:
	- Make film class more data-type agnostic.  It should be the responsibility
	  of the Renderer and Integrator to make sure pixel data is interpretted and
	  used correctly.

- Cleanup:
	- Add NaN and Inf catching to key places in code
