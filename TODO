- Bugs:
	- The "huge_plane" scene segfaults, running off the end of the
	  split primitive stack with a single ray.  If you apply
	  scale, then it stops segfaulting.  Also, if you increase the
	  dicing rate (even just to 0.5) it stops segfaulting.
	- Very small sphere lights introduce severe banding in light attentuation.

- Unit tests:
	- BitStack
	- BitStack2

- Ray stream tracing:
	- Optimizations...


- Infinite lights (e.g. sun lights) will be considered part of the background,
  along with e.g. HDRI lighting backgrounds.

- Parsing:
	- Give useful error messages...

- Implement transforms and instancing:
	- Make LightTree use instances instead of objects
	- Make LightTree take into account transforms

- PsychoBlend:
	- Intelligently decide what to export with motion blur or not
	- Intelligently export instanced geometry only once
	- Export Group instances as assemblies
	- Allow per-object motion blur segment specification

- Implement a shading system
	- Proper ray differentials
	- Stupid simple shaders first
	- Then use OSL

- More geometry types:
	//- Bicubic bezier patches
	- Catmull-clark subdivision surfaces
	- Triangle meshes
	//- Make spheres work again

- Performance improvements:
	- Change MicroSurface to use a BVH4
	- Investigate ways to make splitting and splitting-traversal faster:
		- Can we do BVH4 style traversal?

- Adaptive sampling scheme
	- "Population Monte Carlo"

- Film class:
	- Make film class more data-type agnostic.  It should be the responsibility
	  of the Renderer and Integrator to make sure pixel data is interpretted and
	  used correctly.

- Cleanup:
	- Add NaN and Inf catching to key places in code
	- Surface Primitives should calculate their own pre-displacement surface normals

- Splitting:
	- Splitting code should have protection against stack overflow.
