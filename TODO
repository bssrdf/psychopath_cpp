- Bugs:
	- Very small sphere lights introduce severe banding in light attentuation.

- Iterative intersections:
    //- Figure out how to DRY stuff
    //- Get working with motion blur
    //- Adaptive iteration depth based on ray differentials
    - Displacement tests

- Unit tests:
	- BitStack
	- BitStack2

- Ray stream tracing:
	- Optimizations...

- Multiple importance sampling

- Infinite lights (e.g. sun lights) will be considered part of the background,
  along with e.g. HDRI lighting backgrounds.

- Parsing:
	- Give useful error messages...
	- Support binary geometry files of some kind, for faster scene loading

- PsychoBlend:
	- Export Group instances as assemblies
	- Allow per-object motion blur segment specification

- Shading system
	//- Stupid simple shaders first
	- A few hard-coded displacement shaders, to verify the ideas work (e.g.
	  with interval arithmetic).
	- Then use OSL

- More geometry types:
	- Catmull-clark subdivision surfaces
	- Triangle meshes

- Adaptive sampling scheme
	- "Population Monte Carlo"

- Film class:
	- Make film class more data-type agnostic.  It should be the responsibility
	  of the Renderer and Integrator to make sure pixel data is interpretted and
	  used correctly.

- Cleanup:
	- Add NaN and Inf catching to key places in code
