/**
 * @brief Traces rays in a scene.
 *
 * The Tracer is responsible for doing the actual ray-tracing in a scene.
 * It does _not_ manage the specific integration algorithm, or shading.  Only
 * the tracing of rays and calculating the relevant information about ray
 * hits.
 *
 * It is specifically designed to handle tracing a large number of rays
 * (ideally > a million, as ram allows) simultaneously to gain efficiency
 * in various ways.  The rays do not need to be related to each other or
 * coherent in any way.
 *
 * It is, of course, also capable of tracing a single ray at a time or a small
 * number of rays at a time if necessary. But doing so may be far less
 * efficient depending on the scene.
 *
 * The simplest usage is to add a bunch of rays to the Tracer's queue with
 * queue_rays(), and then trace them all by calling trace_rays().  The
 * resulting intersection data is stored in the rays' data structures directly.
 * Wash, rinse, repeat.
